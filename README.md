# Group Project Movie App (SAR :smile: سَار)

We worked on this project as a group to create Movie App, get the data about movies from TheMovieDB APIs.
https://api.themoviedb.org

<br/>

## Wireframes and User Stories:

### User Stories:
We implement web application that will allow the user to do the following :muscle: :white_check_mark:

- As a user, I can see the latest movies. 
- As a user, I can search movies. 
- As a user, I can add a movie or remove it from my favorites.(must use Redux here) 
- As a user, I can see movie details (Movie Name, Poster, Movie Description, Genres) 


### Wireframes:
<p>You can view application wireframe <a href="https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/196278942458114" rel="nofollow">here</a></p> 

### Deployment: 

 :paperclip: <a href="......" rel="nofollow">Movie App</a>

## Technologies :

### -  React & Redux:
- Must use Redux with at least two actions :white_check_mark:
- Must at least use 3 React hooks useState, useEffect, and useContext :white_check_mark:
- Must be in English and Arabic using react-i18next :white_check_mark:
- Using JS Libraries (axios , i18next, react-router-dom):white_check_mark:

### - MATERIAL-UI
### - JSX & CSS

 ## Example about a short story of Development process and problem-solving strategy :punch: :


As a part of our project, we have favorite movies feature that allows the user to favorite unlimited numbers of movies. However, this feature would have a problem with the way that it works(favorite a movie from the main page Route and show the result of the favorites in a different Route). As a solution, we have decided as a team to solve the problem by using Redux. Redux works as storage that allows us to keep the record of the favorite movies through all the routes.

### Get Started:

```terminal
  $ git clone https://github.com/anas-alhmoud/Project_MovieApp_React.git

  
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
```







### As a Future Work :bulb: :mag_right: : 
- As a user, I can share movie link to IMDB site.
- As a user, I can see similar movies for each movie.
- As a user, I can see as more movie details (Cast names and posters).
- As a user, I can see star details with the list of movies casted in.
- Use Firebase Auth with useContext https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth

- Use localStorage with Redux

- Make it Full Stack using .Net as backend
- Use React Native as your FrontEnd in addition to your web application
